# HueControl
Personal project to program the Philips Hue bridge more easily.

I got fed up on doing all of the configuration manually with a phone without a way to do it on a computer
or to write the same rules for multiple switches at once.

The config is hardcoded and features are missing as this is not meant for public use, it only has what I use.
